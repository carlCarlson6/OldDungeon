Old Dungeon
===============

The intention of this project is to create a mix between an old text adventure and an dungeon crawler. 

The core of the game system is wanted to be as agnostic as possible of the underlaying infrastructure to be able to play from a console or web app.

The game system is based on a simplified (for the moment) version of the spanish role game [Vieja Escula (Old School)](http://viejaescuela.nogarung.com/vieja-escuela-el-juego-de-rol/). Rule book of the game can be found at `./docs/VE_jdr.pdf`.
